The purpose of this is to use all genes in creating the SOM, using only leaf development genes.  These come from Yasu's curated Gene list. 


##Required Libraries

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(kohonen)
library(plyr)
```

Upload Yasu's curated gene list

```{r}
geneList1 <- read.csv("../../pnas.1402835111.sd06.csv")
geneList2 <- read.csv("pnas.1402835111.sd07.csv")
