I'm really interested how stem cells differentiate into entire organs, expecially leaves.....

So when I refer to cellular differentiation, I am refering to a process that occurs in almost every plant cell, it starts a stem cell, 

I use the tomato leaf as a system.  It starts as a lateral bulge off the SAMIt has complex leaves, each region is a leaflet.

Leaves do not differentiate uniformly.  For instance, in tomato and most other plant species there are two main modes of differentiation, 
1.
2. Marginal blastozone

This regions that flanks the sides of the growing primordia maintains meristematic potential longer that the other parts of the cell and has been dfined hitologically for over 40 years as having dense cells and maintence of high rates of cell division.  

I want to know the molecular mechanisms regululating these patterns.  The main question of my project is...

To observe the differentiation pattern from tip to base, I isolated tissue along the longitudinal axis. IN addition I seperated the margin region, which is known to maintain morphogenic potential longer compared to the regions that will become the midvein of the terminal leaflet or the rachis. 

VIDEO:  Because of the small size of these tissues, I used laser capture microdissection to isolate these previously unattainable regions.  This is the base here, I first isolated the marginal blastozone regions which are these dense cells early in the cellular differentation process. And then in addition I isolated everything else, which in this case would be the rachis. 
Then further up these leaflets that have first emmerged. 

Over 4,000 cuts later I had enough tissue to exracted the RNA and make libraries, of the six regions, 5 replicates each, and first performed Differential expression analysis and GO enrichment. 

For instance, In the most sigficantlyI found many go categories associated with photosynthesis, sugar biosynthesis, and many transport categories. 

Which makes sense in the context of cell differentiation, but knowing that this dark purple, midvein region is upregulated in photosynthetic activity over the region that will be come the blade, seemed a little counter intuitive to me. Photosynthesis is upregulated in the midvein compared to the region that will become the blade region? 

So when and where does photosythesis begin on a leaf?  Quickly I found I that  scientists intereseted in photosynthesis are not looking in this young of a stage. Which makes sense, why would you?  I wanted to find out, so we used a construct which shows Chlorophyll AB binding

It is ubiquitis in mature leaves. But where does CAB localize in early in leaf development?  In the midvein and rachis, it is not till later in development that it begins in the margin regions.  Likely because these cells are busy dividing or maintaining meristematic potential and haven't gotten to cell specialization yet.

First here the principle compent analysis performed on normalized gene counts and we observe clear cluster of genes that have similar expression patterns, but I wanted to understand that further. 

Here is an example of when you cluster 1000 wines based on wine content.

You can see that those wines with high alcohol are grouped into this far right cluster, while those high in magnesium and flavanoid are clustered in this far left which typically have low alcohol content.  I'm going to do the same analysis but instead of wine, I have genes and I am categorizing them based on gene expression differences between tissue. 

And when you limit the clusters to just six, you get tissue specific clusters, all of these genes share a similar expression pattern in one specific region.

when you map the clusters back onto our Principle component visualization.  These clusters help define previously established principle component clusters. 

This captulates what we found previously during differential gene expression analysis, but taking all tissues into account at once.

So I am really interested in groups of genes that have the same expression along the whole rachis compared to the margin regions.


I left out to this point, to simplifiy explanation, a whole other line that I isolated the same tissue.
