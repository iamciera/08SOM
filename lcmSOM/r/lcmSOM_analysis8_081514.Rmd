#Analysis 7 - Getting a closer look at the clusters from the clusters from the superSOM, 

##Purpose

To get start to understand the differences in GO categories between the superSOM clusters. 

###Part 1

This will look into the number of genes that are the same between the clusters and the genotypes. With some basic visualization.

Required Libraries

```{r}
library(VennDiagram)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(kohonen)
library(goseq)
library(GO.db)
```

###Visualize by Cluster
Read in data used for GO enrichment analysis

```{r}
geneLength <- read.csv("../../../07GO_enrichment/requisiteData/normalized_genes_length.csv")
cate <- read.table("../../../07GO_enrichment/requisiteData/melted.GOTable.txt",header=TRUE)
```

Read in data produced from analysis1D.
```{r}
plot.data <- read.table("../data/ssom.data.analysis5d.txt",header=TRUE)
names(plot.data)
```


##Cluster Specific analysis
Now I want to take a look at what are is going on exactly in these clusters. The clusters start with the bottom left, which is cluster number 1.

This is a function that makes a boxplot showing the transformed values of expression in the clusters. 

```{r}
#clusterVis Function
#displays transformed data in a box plot 
clusterVis <- function(clustNum){
  
  sub_cluster <- subset(plot.data, ssom.unit.classif==clustNum)
  sub_data <- sub_cluster[,c(1, 9:14)] # just the sample types
  m.data <- melt(sub_data) 
  p <- ggplot(m.data, aes(x=variable, y=value, color = genotype))
  p + geom_point(alpha=0.5,position="jitter", size=1) + 
    geom_boxplot(alpha=0.75, outlier.size=0) + 
    theme_bw()
}
```



```{r}

clusterGO <- function(clustNum){
  ##GO Enrichment on the catergories
   dev.off()
  plot.new()
  
  #we need to first get the data in the right format.
  #First get the list of ITAG
 
  #sub_cluster
  sub_cluster <- subset(plot.data, ssom.unit.classif==clustNum)
  
  itag.sc <- as.data.frame(sub_cluster$gene) 
  colnames(itag.sc)[1] <- "itag"
  itag.sc$sc <- 1    
 
  #Since each orthologue between tf2 and wt are represented twice in this set, we have to keep only the unique ITAGs.
  
  itag.sc <- unique(itag.sc) #Check. Should cut the list in half. # dim(itag.sc) before and after
  
  #Merge all by itag
  matrixGO <- merge(itag.sc, geneLength, by = "itag", all = TRUE)
  matrixGO[is.na(matrixGO)] <- 0
  pat <- matrixGO
  
  #Now that we have the data in the right format we can proceed with GO enrichment.
  
    genes = as.integer(pat[,"sc"])
    names(genes) = pat$itag
    table(genes)
    length(genes)
  
    pwf = nullp(genes,bias.data=pat$length)
  
    GO.wall = goseq(pwf,gene2cat = cate)
    head(GO.wall)
  
  #This is going to correct for multiple testing.  You can specify the p-value cut-off of GO categories you are interested.
  
    enriched.GO = GO.wall$category[p.adjust(GO.wall$over_represented_pvalue, method = "BH") < 0.05]
  
    enriched.GO
  
    my.GO <- as.character(enriched.GO)
    my.GO.table <- Term(my.GO)
    my.GO.table
    t <- as.matrix(my.GO.table)

    print(t) #this is for the knitr document
}
```


```{r}
clusterVis_line <- function(clustNum) {
  sub_cluster <- subset(plot.data, ssom.unit.classif==clustNum)
  sub_data <- sub_cluster[,c(1, 2, 9:14)] # just the sample types
  sub_data <- melt(sub_data)
  sub_data <- within(sub_data, lineGroup <- paste(genotype, gene,sep='.'))
  ggplot(sub_data, aes(variable, value, group = lineGroup, color =  genotype )) + 
    geom_line(alpha = .1, (aes(color = factor(genotype)))) + 
    geom_point(alpha = .0)
  }
```

```{r}
#Prereq annotation files for function

annotation1<- read.delim("../../../06diffGeneExp/analysis/data/ITAG2.3_all_Arabidopsis_ITAG_annotations.tsv", header=FALSE)  #Changed to the SGN human readable annotation
colnames(annotation1) <- c("ITAG", "SGN_annotation")
annotation2<- read.delim ("../../../06diffGeneExp/analysis/data/ITAG2.3_all_Arabidopsis_annotated.tsv")
annotation <- merge(annotation1,annotation2, by = "ITAG")
#Only Gene Name and ITAG
annotation <- annotation[,c(1,5)]
```

Function
```{r}
genesInClust <- function(clustNum) {
  sub_cluster <- subset(plot.data, ssom.unit.classif==clustNum)
  sub_data <- as.data.frame(sub_cluster[,2])
  colnames(sub_data) <- "ITAG"
  resultsTable <- merge(sub_data,annotation,by = "ITAG", all.x=TRUE)
  print(nrow(resultsTable))
#  return(resultsTable <- unique(resultsTable))
  return(unique(resultsTable))
  }

genesInClust <- function(clustNum, plot.data, annotation) {
  sub_cluster <- subset(plot.data, ssom.unit.classif==clustNum)
  sub_data <- as.data.frame(sub_cluster[,2])
  colnames(sub_data) <- "ITAG"
  resultsTable <- merge(sub_data,annotation,by = "ITAG", all.x=TRUE)
  print(nrow(unique(resultsTable)))
  return(unique(resultsTable))
  }


```

###Cluster 1

```{r}
clusterVis(1)
clusterVis_line(1)
clusterGO(1)
```

###Cluster 2

```{r}

###Cluster 3 

Ambr in WT is higher than in *tf2* and the WT genes in this cluster have a tight pattern.

```{r}

clusterVis_line(3)
clusterGO(3)
```

Understanding the GO categories of cluster 3.

- [Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine_ammonia-lyase) is the first and committed step in the phenyl propanoid pathway and is therefore involved in the biosynthesis of the polyphenol compounds such as flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, and lignin in plants. 

- [histidine ammonia-lyase activity](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR005921) - breaks down histidine, which is functionally attributed to [metal ion transport](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00726-005-0247-0).

- serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity - peptide cleaving.

- [Chromoplasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromoplast) are plastids, heterogeneous organelles responsible for pigment synthesis and storage in specific photosynthetic eukaryotes.

- cotyledon development

- Chromoplast 

- [positive regulation of development, heterochronic](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0045962) Any process that modulates the consistent predetermined time point at which an integrated living unit or organism progresses from an initial condition to a later condition and increases the rate at which this time point is reached.

###Cluster 4 

```{r}
clusterVis(4)
clusterVis_line(4)
clusterGO(4)
```

###Cluster 5 


```{r}
clusterVis(5)
clusterVis_line(5)
clusterGO(5)

###Cluster  6

```{r}
clusterVis(6)
clusterVis_line(6)
clusterGO(6)

##Large SOM

After viewing the `clusterVis_line()` clusters in `lcmSOM_analysis8_081514.Rmd`, I saw that there were a lot of noise that was associated in these main clusters.  I think if I make more clusters I can begin to see tighter gene expression clusters. I redid the clusters which are presented in the fie `analysis5d_081814.Rmd` where I specified for more clusters, this is the visulization of that.

###Cmbr

This is exploring the regions that differ in the CMBR.  What Clusters are very similar in everything BUT the CMBR?

```{r}
clusterVis(4)
clusterVis_line(4)
y <- genesInClust(4, plot.data, annotation)
```

I need to write something that looks at the statistical difference in tissue between each genotype.  In order to do that I have to subset based on tissue and do a t-test?  Do I need to correct for multiple testing? Ideally what information do I want from these clusters?

1. I want clusters that are enriched in leaf genes. Maybe I could just color special for leaf genes? done.

2. Significant differences between genotype at each tissue.
