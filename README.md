# Super Organized Mapping

This directory is used for analysis done using Super Organized Mapping (SOM).  I was working on a specific project, but mainly this whole repository was exploritory work done to understand my data better and learn the `kohonen` R package ([link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kohonen/kohonen.pdf)).  

## Main Directory

`example_data`: Example projects I used to learn.
`lcmSOM`: analysis for my project.
`readings`: Literature I found helpful.

All my R analysis for my project are [here](https://github.com/iamciera/08SOM/tree/master/lcmSOM/r), in the lcmSOM directory.  They are all in `.Rmd` (R markdown). This is so I can output the analysis as reports.  All code should work if you set the home directory to the source file directory. The `README.md` file in `lcmSOM` root, will tell you a basic summary of all the analysis that were performed.  If you want a nice overview of cluster analysis, check out the `.pdf` output of [lcmSOM_analysis9.5_081814](https://github.com/iamciera/08SOM/blob/master/lcmSOM/r/lcmSOM_analysis9.5_081814.pdf).

Let me know if you have any questions. The final repository for these analysis will come out with the manuscript soon and will be clearer.
